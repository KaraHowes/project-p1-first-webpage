# Project Name

Here is my basic website design for a blog post. I detail designing a bedroom for my daughter.

The brief was to design a basic webpage, including images.

## The problem

My approach was to use a design board I had previously designed, to illustrate how I designed a bedrrom for my 8-year old daughter. 
I added internet links to sources for the items. I have used Adobe Illustrator jpg files, added a menu section and some styling. 
I would like to usee CSS Grid next time to style (I feel my website is a bit too basic and amateur-ish)
